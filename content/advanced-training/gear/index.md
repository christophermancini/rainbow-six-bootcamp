Experienced Rainbow Six operators will choose their gear wisely before entering into combat. Making the right decision on what gear to equip can have a significant impact on the success of the operation.

Their are three main types of gear you need to select from: [Gadgets]({{<ref "#gadgets">}}), [Primary Weapons]({{<ref "#primary-weapons">}}) and [Secondary Weapons]({{<ref "#secondary-weapons">}})

Beyond selecting your weapons, you can also outfit them with [attachments]({{< ref "#weapon-attachments" >}}) to match your situational needs and [skins]({{< ref "#weapon-skins" >}}) to add a little personality.
