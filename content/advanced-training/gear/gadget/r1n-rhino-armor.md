The R1N "Rhino" Armor Pack is a bag full of armor plates that can be equipped by Rook's team. It provides a little bit extra protection against projectiles.

## Usage

Rook can place his R1N "Rhino" Armor Pack pretty much anywhere on the ground. Once it is placed, an icon appears within teammates HUDs to signal them that armor is available. Rook can also equip himself with an extra armor plate.

## Notes

- Drones can be blocked by the armor pack if placed directly in front of a drone entryway / hole.
- If any armor plates are left within the pack on the floor, attackers can equip one themselves, gaining the same benefit.
