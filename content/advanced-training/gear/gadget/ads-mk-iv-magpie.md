The ADS-MK IV "Magpie" is an active defense system designed to intercept grenades thrown into a room.
It uses its advanced cameras to identify and target explosives to be disabled before they reach
their intended destination.

## Usage

To make use of the ADS-MK IV, simply place the device on a wall within the fortified room you are defending.

## Notes

- Placing on a reinforced wall with a [CED-1]({{< ref "ced-1.md" >}}) device attached will result with it being destroyed
- Placing it on a wall or too close to a wall that has not been reinforced and later is, will result with it being destroyed
- Intercepts grenades from [Fuze's]({{< ref "fuze.md" >}}) [cluster charge]({{< ref "apm-6-matryoshka-cluster-charge.md" >}})
