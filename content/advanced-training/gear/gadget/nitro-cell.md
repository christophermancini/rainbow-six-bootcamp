The Nitro Cell is a C4 packed explosive device that can be detonated remotely.

## Usage

You can place the Nitro Cell to set a trap and detonate it when enemies come near. It has a sticky adhesive on the bottom side of the device, allowing you to toss it onto any surface.

However, do to the fact that the Nitro Cell emits a fairly loud buzz and has a bright blinking light, it is easily identified and eliminated by enemy operators. This makes it less useful as a remotely detonated trap causing operators to use it more like a grenade, tossing it through entryways and detonating it immediately.

## Notes

- You can still hip fire your equipped firearm while detonating your C4 explosive.
