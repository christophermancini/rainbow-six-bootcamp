Razor wire can be deployed on any walkable surface. When attackers begin walking through razor wire, it slows down their movement, causes a small amount of damage and creates noise that can be heard by nearby defenders. It also interferes with drone movement.

## Usage

Stand approximately one step in front of where you want to place the razor wire and activate your secondary gadget button / key.

## Notes

- Can be placed on stairs
- Can be electrified with [Bandit's CED-1]({{< ref "ced-1.md" >}})
