Ash is the only female operator on team Rainbow from the [FBI SWAT]({{< ref "fbi-swat.md" >}}) unit. She is equipped with light armor, making her one of the faster operators in the game. Her [M120 CREM]({{< ref "m120-crem.md" >}}) enables her to breach fortified entryways from a safe distance and combined with her explosive speed, gives her the advantage of keeping her enemies clueless of her location.<!--more-->

## Bio

Eliza Cohen cut her teeth serving in her native Israel's IDF. She's currently part of FBI SWAT thanks to an international law enforcement exchange program.

Cohen brought her knowledge of demolitions with her in producing a weapon-mounted breach charge capable of blowing open a door or wall from a distance.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

Cohen was born and raised in Jerusalem. After secondary school, she enrolled at Tel Aviv University, in the Engineering program, where she did a semester abroad at Boston University. After college she performed her civic duty enlisting in the Israeli Defense Forces. Her background in engineering made her a prime candidate for mechanical maintenance and demolitions.

### Psychological Profile

Her military training as a demolitions specialist has left Cohen with an inflated sense of self. She can be aggressive, impulsive, and overly confident. She is quick to action, which can be an asset or fatal for someone in her line of work.

* Tel Aviv University: Bachelor of Science, Engineering
* Israeli Air Force
* Shaldag
* FBI SWAT (JINSA LEEP)

### Relevant Experience
