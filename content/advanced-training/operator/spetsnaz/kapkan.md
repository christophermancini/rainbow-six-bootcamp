Intro / description paragraph...<!--more-->

## Bio

Growing up in a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, Shuhrat Kessikbayev emigrated to Russia shortly before the fall of the Soviet Union. He is an expert tinkerer and master craftsman, more at ease with the workings of machines than people.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born and raised in Kovrov, Basuda is the eldest of three sons to parents who were factory workers. Hoping to escape the grueling life in the factory, he enlisted with the [Ministry of Internal Affairs](https://en.mvd.ru/) and was sent to Naryan Mar, a small sea and river port town on the Barents Sea. Basuda became an avid hunter and trapper during his time in the Arctic Circle, before being transferred to Beslan in 2002.

### Psychological Profile

Basuda is a self-sufficient realist. He has seen the harsh reality of the world and does not allow that to hinder his ability to act. He's fascinated by psychology; what allows one creature to become a hunter and the other prey.

### Training

* Ministry of Internal Affairs, Police Officer
* Spetsnaz

### Relevant Experience

* [Beslan School Siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beslan_school_siege)

### Notes

* Designs / builds snares and traps as a hobby.
