## Tactical Profile

### Background

Kessikbayev grew up in a military family in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. After his family emigrated to Russia shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kessikbayev followed in his father's footsteps and enrolled in the military, where his facility with technology earned him a spot in the coveted weapon testing brigade at Alabino firing range near Moscow.

### Psychological Profile

Kessikbayev is an expert tinkerer and master of craftsman, more at ease with the workings of machines than people. His gruff demeanor and curt speech should not be mistaken for misanthropy. He possesses a strong moral conviction.

* 27th Motor Rifle Brigade
* Spetsnaz GRU GSO

### Relevant Experience

* Participant in Ratnik experimental weaponry brigade.
* Personal cluster charge, the "Matryoshka", designed by Kessikbayev first saw action in REDACTED
