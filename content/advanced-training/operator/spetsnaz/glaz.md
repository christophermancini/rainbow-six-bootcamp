## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born and raised in Vladivostok, where his father worked in the shipping industry. Glazkov studied art in secondary school, until the Beslan school hostage crisis inspired him to transfer to the Cadet Corps and pursue a career in the armed forces.

### Psychological Profile

While Timur doesn't thrive in large groups, he is engaging and expressive in one-on-one conversations. He has a patient temperament and can be very introspective. His background as an artist, his curiosity, and attention to detail has trained him to be mindful and precise. This trait makes Timur and excellent sniper and spotter.

### Training

* Cadet Corps
* Ground Forces of the Russian Federation
* Khabarovsk Military Commanders Training Academy
* Spetsnaz: 45th Guards Regiment

### Relevant Experience

* Saw action in the 2008 South Ossetia War.
* Deployed in REDACTED

### Notes

While he is quiet in person he is a skilled painter. His art is expressive and colorful, a stark contrast to his military life.
