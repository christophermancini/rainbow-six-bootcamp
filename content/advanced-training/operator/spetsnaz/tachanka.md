Intro / description paragraph...<!--more-->

## Bio

Alexsandr Senaviev is an iconoclast who came of age in a pre-glasnost red army family and has retained an interest in soviet machinery and weaponry. During operations, he deploys a signature vintage mounted machine gun that he has restored and maintained with loving care.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born into a Red Army family, Senaviev enlisted when he turned eighteen. After the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan, Senaviev was transferred to the Spetsnaz shortly before the collapse of the Union.

### Psychological Profile

Calm in crises. Alex harbors a joyous, if acerbic outlook. He has a limited social filter, which has gotten him into trouble in the past.

### Training

* Soviet Army
* Spetsnaz

### Relevant Experience

* Soviet War in Afghanistan
* Chechnya
* Georgia

### Notes

A collector of Soviet-era weaponry, he prefers simple designs proven to be effective, over the modern experimental technology and warefare.
