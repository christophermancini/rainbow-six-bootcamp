## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born into a family of stevedores, Baker enlisted for active military duty on his eighteenth birthday. A veteran of three wars, Baker was the oldest SAS operative on active duty until he was recruited by Rainbow.

### Psychological Profile

Baker is highly observant, calculating and decisive. While his demeanor may denote traces of impatient cynicism, Baker possesses a profound sense of ethical responsibility. It is recommended to assign Baker with junior operators of strong moral conviction, whom he can mentor.

### Training

British Army: Parachhute Regiment
British Army: SAS Bravo Two Zero
British Army: SAS Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major)

### Relevant Experience

Baker's exemplary performance, on and off the battlefield, during two politically-charged conflicts (see: notes) made him a natural fit for VIP protection duty. He is highly proficient in close quarters combat, and is a world-caliiber expert in anti-electronics operations.

### Notes

Saw action at the battle of Goose Green during the Falklands Conflict.
On Team Blue of Operation Nimrod (Iranian Embassy siege, 1980).
