## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born into a family of stevedores, Baker enlisted for active military duty on his eighteenth birthday. A veteran of three wars, Baker was the oldest SAS operative on active duty until he was recruited by Rainbow.

### Psychological Profile

Baker is highly observant, calculating and decisive. While his demeanor may denote traces of impatient cynicism, Baker possesses a profound sense of ethical responsibility. It is recommended to assign Baker with junior operators of strong moral conviction, whom he can mentor.

### Training

British Army: Parachhute Regiment
British Army: SAS Bravo Two Zero
British Army: SAS Warrant Officer Class 1 (Regimental Sergeant Major)

### Relevant Experience

Baker's exemplary performance, on and off the battlefield, during two politically-charged conflicts (see: notes) made him a natural fit for VIP protection duty. He is highly proficient in close quarters combat, and is a world-caliiber expert in anti-electronics operations.

### Notes

Saw action at the battle of Goose Green during the Falklands Conflict.
On Team Blue of Operation Nimrod (Iranian Embassy siege, 1980).
Veteran of unit Bravo Two Zero during Gulf War (1991).
