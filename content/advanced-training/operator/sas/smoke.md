## Tactical Profile

### Background

Porter was not an academic, although in secondary school he excelled in science. He took a particular interest in biology and the unit on dissection. During his gap year, Porter enlisted in the British Army, using a fake ID to circumvent parental consent.

### Psychological Profile

Porter is a thrill seeker with very little regard for his personal safety. He is fearless in battle and can be a great asset for defensive maneuvers. However, he seems to enjoy the havoc and chaos of war. He tends to have an odd sense of humor in stressful situations. Can be narcissistic.

### Training

* British Army
* SAS Operative

### Relevant Experience

After basic training, Porter was stationed in Belfast. Finding the posting a bit dull in the wake of March 2007 treaty, he joined the Army Boxing Team as a middleweight.

### Notes

None
