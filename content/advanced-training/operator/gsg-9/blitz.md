## Tactical Profile

### Background
A student of [Hermann-Böse-Gymnasium](http://www.hbg.schule.bremen.de/), Kötz excelled academically
and as a sportsman in HBG's bilingual program. His imposing physique made him an exceptional athlete,
he carried his experience on the field into his military training. His jovial nature and academic
background eased the transition from a [Schnelle Kräfte](http://www.deutschesheer.de/portal/a/heer/!ut/p/c4/04_SB8K8xLLM9MSSzPy8xBz9CP3I5EyrpHK9jNTUIr2UzNS84pLiEr2U4mz9gmxHRQC5SF74/) soldier in Kosovo to a member of the GSG 9. Kötz was integral to establishing an anti-terrorism unit in India following the 2008 attack in Mumbai.

### Psychological Profile

Kötz has seen his share of battlefield horrors but is mentally resilient. He uses humor to disarm and
as a device to manage stress during operations. He is the first to rush a barricade and is always willing
to place the team's safety over his own. Kötz rejects the concept that his deeds are in some way heroic.
When faced with overt praise, he will become self-effacing.
