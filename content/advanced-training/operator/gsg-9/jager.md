## Tactical Profile

### Background

Raised by his uncle, a mechanic for what became the Bundespolizei (BPOL) Aviation Group after reunification, Streicher joined BPOL as a helicopter technician. In BPOL he began designing defensive weapon systems, including a ground-based Active Defense System (ADS) prototype that caught the attention of GSG 9.

### Psychological Profile

Streicher is highly creative and curious, with a strong desire to serve. He has a tendency to lack humility. Though he has a remarkable affinity for complex machinery, he is not adept at reading social cues. Coupled with his boisterous tendencies he can be a bit abrasive.

### Training

Bundespolizei: Helicopter Technician, Weapons Maintenance
GSG 9: Technical Advisor
GSG 9: Operator

### Relevant Experience
