Intro / description paragraph...<!--more-->

## Bio

A former undercover agent within the Hannover Hells Angels, Brunsmeier is known for taking obsolete items and repurposing them into weapons. He has cobbled together a device that can electrify barbed wires and barricades, and injure or destroy anything that comes into contact with it.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

Brunsmeier and his twin brother Cedrick joined the [Bundesgrunzschutz (BGS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police_(Germany)) the day after their eighteenth birthday. Stationed with the border patrol he would spend his first year getting accustomed to following orders and filing paperwork.

### Psychological Profile

A prankster, Brunsmeier honors and humiliates his brother's memory each time he deploys the Crude Electrical Device (CED), the weapon responsible for Cedrick's early retirement from the BGS. Resourceful and adaptive, Brunsmeier relies on his cunning for survival.

### Training

* Bundespolizei formerly known as Bundesgrunzschutz (BGS)
* Weiterstadt Red Army Faction
* GSG 9
* GSG 9 Undercover Agent Hannover Hell's Angels

### Relevant Experience

In his second year with BGS, Brunsmeier was assigned to a joint task force aimed at quelling the growing threat of the [Red Army Faction (RAF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction). In 2006 he was recruited by GSG 9 to go undercover, where he would spend four years imbedded with the Hannover Chapter of the Hell's Angels.
