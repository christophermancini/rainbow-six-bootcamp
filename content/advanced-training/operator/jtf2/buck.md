## Bio

## Tactical Profile

### Background

A Montreal native, Côté always wanted to lead an unconventional life. He enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces via the Regular Officer Training Plan, which allowed him to attend University and obtain a degree in Criminology. After graduation he became an MP in the Canadian Army. When his time in the Army was completed he joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and eventually became part of the Emergency Response Team. After excelling in his ERT role he was invited by the Canadian Military to re-up and become a member of [JTF2]({{< ref "jtf2.md" >}}).

### Psychological Profile

Highly pragmatic, Côté will always take the shortest distance between two points. He is not one to mince words, or become hyperbolic. He enjoys simple mechanical devices to the more high tech arsenal employed by other members of Team Rainbow.
