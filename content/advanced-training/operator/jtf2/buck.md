## Bio

Born and Raised in Montreal, Sebastien Côté is a highly pragmatic person who enjoys simple mechanical devices over the high tech arsenal employed by other operators. The Skeleton Key, an under-barrel mounted 12 gauge shotgun, allows Côté to swiftly breach and target hostiles, by changing hand positions on his assault rifle.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

A Montreal native, Côté always wanted to lead an unconventional life. He enrolled in the Canadian Armed Forces via the Regular Officer Training Plan, which allowed him to attend University and obtain a degree in Criminology. After graduation he became an MP in the Canadian Army. When his time in the Army was completed he joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and eventually became part of the Emergency Response Team. After excelling in his ERT role he was invited by the Canadian Military to re-up and become a member of [JTF2]({{< ref "jtf2.md" >}}).
