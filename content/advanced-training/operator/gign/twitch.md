Twitch is French born operator with Medium armor and speed with an affinity for engineering. She offers immense amounts of versatility in play style which is why she is an incredibly valuable operator within Team Rainbow. Having three very different weapons available ([417]({{< ref "417.md" >}}), [F2]({{< ref "f2.md" >}}), and [SG CQB]({{< ref "sg-cqb.md" >}})) combined with the [RSD Model1 Shock Drone]({{< ref "rsd-model1-shock-drone.md" >}}) are what enable her to be so versatile.<!--more-->

## Operator Review

### Loadout Highlights

 - The [HK 417 Battle Rifle]({{< ref "417.md" >}}) is one of the highest rated rifles in the game for a [marksman operator]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#marksman-score" >}}) and is only available to Twitch.
 - The [Famas F2 Assault Rifle]({{< ref "f2.md" >}}) is one of the highest rated rifles for a [player operating solo or rogue]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#rogue-score" >}}) and also is only available to Twitch.

### Strengths

Twitch's strengths lie within her versatility to assume many different roles within Team Rainbow. Whether you need a marksman to provide intel and cover as your team breaches, an operator to go solo and distract the enemies while the team breaches from the other side, or extra firepower on the front lines, Twitch is your gal.

### Weaknesses

Although Twitch has one of the best stealth weapons in the game, her medium armor reduces her mobility. This increases her dependency on intel and her need to use her drones effectively.

## Bio

Emmanuelle Pichon is an expert technologist with a penchant for using gadgetry to aid her squad. She enters operations with a small drone capable of delivering disabling electric shocks to hostile forces and their traps.

## Tactical Profile

### Background

Born in historic town of Nancy, Pichon grew up in a family that valued education, particularly math and science. Early participation in sponsored computer programming competitions led her to joining the army cadets at sixteen.

### Psychological Profile

Pichon demonstrates an affinity for complex robotic systems and mechanical processes, due to an early exposure to analytical problem solving. This ability transcends academia. Unlike many engineers who have propensity to be emotionally disconnected or apathetic, Pichon is strongly intuitive and empathetic. She believes that technology's best use is to improve the quality of life. This principle motivates Pichon in her military service.

### Training

* Self-trained robotics expert
* French Army: Engineers (Genie)
* GIGN

### Relevant Experience

* Chad
* Libya

### Notes

Despite her young age, Pichon shows exemplary promise as a support specialist. At twenty years old, she was the youngest operative to ever be accepted into the GIGN.
