Rainbow Six operators are the best law enforcement agents from around the world. They endlessly train, evolving their skills because in their line of work, every fraction of a second can be the difference between life and death.

## Recruit

The Rainbow Six Recruit is the initial operator that you start with. As a recruit, you have access to the weapons and gadgets  of the best [Counter Terrorism Units]({{< ref "counter-terrorist-unit.md" >}}) around the world. What you don't have access to as a recruit is weapon modifications, weapon skins, and the unique gadgets used by the named operators.

## Named Operators

There are currently twenty named operators across the five CTUs included in the game. Each operator needs to be unlocked using [Renown]({{< ref "renown-rainbow-credits.md" >}}) points. How many points it costs to unlock an operator is based on how many you have unlocked per CTU, starting with 500RP for your first operator of a CTU and increasing by 500RP for each additional operator. For example, to purchase [Ash]({{< ref "ash.md" >}}) as your first operator from the [FBI SWAT]({{< ref "fbi-swat.md" >}}) unit, you will spend 500RP. If you then want to purchase [Thermite]({{< ref "thermite.md" >}}) as your second operator, it will now cost you 1000RP.
