There have been eleven published games, one canceled game and five different expansion packs or h2c in the Rainbow Six franchise to date.

<h2>Rainbow Six</h2>

The very first game in the series that defined a new style of combat games where strategy is more important than aim. Developed by Red Storm Entertainment and published in 1998 for PC and several consoles, it was very positive on PC but did not fair well on current generation consoles. The game had one expansion mission pack called Eagle Watch. Read more @ [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six_%28video_game%29)

<h2>Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear</h2>

The second installment in the series, Rogue Spear continued what was at this point a major success for Red Storm Entertainment. Released in 1999, the game had three expansions over the following 2 years. Read more @ [Wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Clancy%27s_Rainbow_Six:_Rogue_Spear)

<h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Take-Down â€“ Missions in Korea</h2>

Lockdown was released in 2005 and takes the role as the true 4th game in the series.

Unfortunately, the development teams shifted far enough away from the game mechanics that franchise fans grew to love, that the game received mixed reviews.

<h2>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Critical Hour</h2>

Critical Hour was released the following year after Lockdown, in 2006. Many gaming publications speculated that Critical Hour was rushed out due to the mixed reviews of Lockdown.
