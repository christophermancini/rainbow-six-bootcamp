As [Rainbow Six Siege operators]({{<ref "operators.md">}}) gain experience, they increase their clearance level. Clearance level will grant you access to more content, like [ranked multiplayer]({{<ref "game-modes.md#ranked-multiplayer">}}) at level 20. Also, your clearance level is a status symbol of your skill and experience in the game. Reaching a clearance level of 50 will unlock the "To the Top" trophy / achievement.

 At this time, the maximum clearance level is unknown or infinite as players have reported clearance levels of over 100.
