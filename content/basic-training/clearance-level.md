As [Rainbow Six Siege operators]({{<ref "operators.md">}}) gain experience, they increase their clearance level. Clearance level will grant you access to more content, like [ranked multiplayer]({{<ref "game-modes.md#ranked-multiplayer">}}).

Also, your clearance level is a status symbol of your skill and experience in the game. Reaching a clearance level of 50 will unlock the "To the Top" trophy / achievement.
