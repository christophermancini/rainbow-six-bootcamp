There are currently three primary game modes of Rainbow Six Siege; Situation, Multiplayer and Terror Hunt. Within those, is several more secondary modes.

## Situation Mode (PVE)

Situation mode is a single player mode designed to teach you the important components of game play. There are ten total different situations you are presented with overcoming as a Rainbow Six operator. Each one is supposed to get more difficult and expose you to not only all of the different types of objectives of the game, but also unique gadgets that come along with each of the unlock-able Rainbow Six operators.

Also situation mode offers three levels of difficulty (Normal, Hard, and Realistic) and three challenges to be completed that earn you extra renown.

## Multiplayer Mode (PVP)

Multiplayer mode places you with four other operators playing against five operators via a match making server. There are three types of multiplayer game play, casual, ranked and custom. Essentially multiplayer is team death match with the addition of playing to achieve an objective, either as an attacker or a defender. The three different possible scenarios are Bomb, Hostage, or Biohazard container.

### Ranked Multiplayer

Ranked multiplayer is just like casual, except doing bad things will earn you a temporary ban and doing good things will move you up the leaderboard ranks.

* Ranked matches have voting on spawn/objective location
* Ranked matches do NOT have Death Replays
* Ranked matches will utilize a minimal HUD setting
* No scoring indicators
* No grenade indicators
* No threat indicators
* No reload indicators
* No teammate outline
* No kill confirmation marker

### Custom Multiplayer

Custom multiplayer mode allows you to start your own match with a set rotation of maps and scenarios. Custom games do not get queued up for match making, so other players need to explicitly go to the custom multiplayer game screen to join. Here are more details about Custom matches.

* Will be playable on dedicated servers (in an update shortly after launch), with the following constraints:
* Match requires 10 players in it
* The data center that will host the game will be the closest one to the player who created the custom game session.
* Once the lobby has been created, the server will wait a certain amount of time for it to be filled up to 10 players. If the wait duration goes above a certain limit, the custom game session will be cancelled.
* Custom games hosted on dedicated servers will not be listed and will be accessed by invitation only, after the lobby is created.
* Custom matches that arenâ€™t held on dedicated servers (LAN or peer-to-peer) will be listed in a server browser.

## Terrorist Hunt Mode (PVE)

Terrorist hunt mode allows you to play the scenarios available for multiplayer mode against terrorist bots. There are four different scenarios that you will be ordered to execute as a Rainbow Six Operator:

### Terrorist Hunt Classic

The objective of this mode is to eliminate all enemy terrorists that are fortified within the compound.

### Hostage Extraction

This mode requires you to locate and safely extract the hostage back to a certain location on the map.

### Protect Asset

You and your team have been ordered to protect a high value asset at all costs, you start off within a room and need to fortify defenses before attackers arrive to eliminate your asset.

### Disarm Bombs

Terrorists have fortified a target location and armed two bombs that are minutes away from detonation. You need to infiltrate their defenses and disarm both bombs.
