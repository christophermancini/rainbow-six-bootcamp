There are two different currencies used within Rainbow Six Siege, Renown & Rainbow Credits, which allow you to purchase operators, weapon mods and skins.

## Renown

Renown is the main currency in the game. It is the only way to unlock [operators]({{< ref "operators.md" >}}) and [weapon attachments]({{< ref "advanced-training/gear/index.md#weapon-attachments">}}). It can also be used to purchase [weapon skins]({{< ref "advanced-training/gear/index.md#weapon-skins" >}}).

You gain renown three ways:

- watching the three introductory tutorials in game
- rewarded for completing [challenges]({{< ref "challenges.md" >}})
- rewarded for playing a complete match in any [game mode]({{< ref "game-modes.md" >}}) except custom

### Match Reward

Getting renown for completing a match is how you will get most of your renown. The amount of renown rewarded depends on the difficulty for PVE and whether you are playing [Ranked or Casual for PVP]({{< ref "game-modes.md#pvp-multiplayer" >}}). You will get a higher reward for Realistic difficulty on PVE [situations]({{< ref "game-modes.md#pve-situations" >}}) or [terrorist hunt]({{< ref "game-modes.md#pve-terrorist-hunt" >}}) than you will on normal. You will get a higher reward from a [Ranked] PVP match versus a Casual match.
