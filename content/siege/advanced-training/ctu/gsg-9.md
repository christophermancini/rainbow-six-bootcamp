# History

"After the 1972 Munich Massacre, GSG 9 was formed to combat the growing thread of terrorism. Due to a problematic military history, GSG 9 grew from the German Federal Border Guard Service / Police. GSG 9 specializes in mitigating crisis situations, such as hostage-taking, kidnapping, terrorism, and extortion."
