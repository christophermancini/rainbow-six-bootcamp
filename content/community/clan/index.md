A clan is essentially a team of players that compete in an online game. As part of our commitment to the community, we provide a directory for clans to improve awareness for recruiting as well help players interested in joining a clan find one.

## Add Your Clan

If you would like to add your clan to the directory, you need to create a GitHub account, visit the [Rainbow Six Bootcamp website repository](http://github.com/christophermancini/rainbow-six-bootcamp) and ["fork"](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) it. Clone the repo onto your computer, get [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) if you don't already have it, then use `hugo new community/clan/clan-name.md -k clan` (replacing "clan-name" with the name of your clan in all lowercase and hyphens instead of spaces). Open the file you created, `/content/community/clan/clan-name.md`, in a text editor (TextEdit, Notepad, SublimeText, Atom, etc.), finally fill in the values at the top of the page and write some info about your clan. This is your page, be creative. The very last step is to submit your changes as a [GitHub pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) back to the main site repo.
