A clan is essentially a team of players that compete in an online game. As part of our commitment to the community, we provide a directory for clans to improve awareness for recruiting as well help players interested in joining a clan find one.

To get your clan listed, view our instructions on the [Add your Rainbow Six Siege clan]({{< ref "add-your-clan.md">}}) page.
