In order for [Rainbow Six Bootcamp](/) to be a valuable asset to the [Rainbow Six Siege](http://rainbow6.ubi.com/siege/) community, we need to have great content. Creating great content is very time consuming as it requires collecting digital assets (images, gifs, and video), research, and copywriting. When you are also wearing the hats of front-end developer, back-end developer, server admin, seo specialist, social media manager, information architect, husband, father and full time employee; it leaves very little time to even play the game let alone write content for it. This is why I am asking for your help.<!--more-->

## Content Bounty Program

I need help producing great content for the community and to encourage that, I am officially launching a [content bounty program]({{< ref "content-bounty-program.md" >}}). The TL;DR version is that I will post a list of pages I need help producing content for and if you are the first to submit great content for that page, you will receive a reward.

## First Round of Bounties

You will be able to check the [Rainbow Six Bootcamp Content Bounty Board on GitHub](https://github.com/christophermancini/rainbow-six-bootcamp/wiki/Content-Bounty-Board) periodically to see if I have posted new bounties. The first round of bounties I am posting are to help me get the maps pages completed. I have already done a great deal of work with the [House Map]({{< ref "house.md" >}}) and you can use that as a guide towards what I am looking for with the other maps pages.
