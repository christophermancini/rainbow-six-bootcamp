Official announcement of a new Rainbow Six Bootcamp feature: [Weapon Ratings]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md" >}}) based on play style. We developed algorithms to evaluate weapons based on various play styles.<!--more-->

For instance, if you are going to play a round sneaking around, surprising enemies and taking them out swiftly, then you may want to review the highest [Rogue Score]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#rogue-score" >}}) rated weapons.

At the moment, we have developed ratings for three different play styles, [Rogue]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#rogue-score" >}}), [Marksman]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#marksman-score" >}}) and [Support]({{< ref "weapon-ratings.md#support-score" >}}).

You can view all of the weapons with ratings on the [Operator Gear]({{< ref "advanced-training/gear/index.md#primary-weapons" >}}) page.
